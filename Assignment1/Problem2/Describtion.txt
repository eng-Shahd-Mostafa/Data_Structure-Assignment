                                             Problem #2 Polynomial Operations Using Pointers

Write a program that dynamically allocates arrays to store polynomials and performs operations on them. Given two polynomials, implement functions to:

1. Display the polynomial in a readable format. (4 pt)
2. Calculate the sum of two polynomials. (3 pt)
3. Calculate the difference (subtract the first from the second). (3 pt)
4. Write testcase for each part in the problem

Example 1
Input:
Order of first polynomial: 2
Enter polynomial: 0 1 3 2
Order of second polynomial: 4
Enter polynomial: 8 0 4 0 0 3

Output:
First polynomial: 2x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0
Second polynomial: 3x^4 + 4x = 8
Sum of polynomials: 3x^4 + 2x^2 + 7x + 1 = 8
Difference of polynomials: 3x^4 - 2x^2 + x - 1 = 8

Example 2
Input:
Order of first polynomial: 3
Enter polynomial: 0 5 0 1 4
Order of second polynomial: 3
Enter polynomial: 0 2 3 0 6

Output:
First polynomial: 4x^3 + x^2 + 5 = 0
Second polynomial: 6x^3 + 3x + 2 = 0
Sum of polynomials: 10x^3 + x^2 + 3x + 7 = 0
Difference of polynomials: 2x^3 - x^2 + 3x - 3 = 0
