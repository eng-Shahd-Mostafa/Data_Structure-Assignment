                                                      Problem #1: Iftar Invitation Manager

Problem Statement:
==================
Fatima loves hosting Iftar gatherings for friends and family. Since she invites different guests on different
days, she needs a system to track invitations, including the guest’s name, contact details, and the date they’re invited.
Your task is to create an object-oriented program that:

1. Stores information about each guest invited for Iftar.
2. Displays a list of all invitations.
3. Allows Fatima to update the guest list if she adds or removes a guest.
4. Send a reminder message to guests on a specific date.
5. Write testcase for each part in the problem

Requirements:
1. Create a Guest class
Each guest should have the following attributes:
● name (string) → The guest’s name (e.g., "Aisha").
● contact (string) → Their phone number or email.
● iftar_date (string) → The date they’re invited (e.g., "2025-03-15").
Include the following methods:
● display_guest() → Prints guest details.
● update_invitation(new_date) → Updates the guest’s invitation date.

2. Create an IftarManager class
This class manages multiple invitations and has:
● guest_list (list) → A list that stores multiple Guest objects.
● add_guest(guest) → Adds a new guest. (2 pt)
● display_all_guests() → Displays all invited guests. (2 pt)
● update_guest_invitation(name, new_date) → Updates a guest’s invitation date. (2 pt)
● send_reminder(date) → Sends a reminder message to all guests on a specific date by email. (5 pt)
● sort_guest_list() → Sort guests by invitation date use any sorting algorithm. (4 pt)

Example Usage: In main() function

# Create Iftar Manager
manager = IftarManager()

# Add guests
guest1 = Guest("Aisha", "aisha@example.com", "2025-03-15")
guest2 = Guest("Omar", "omar@example.com", "2025-03-18")
guest3 = Guest("Zainab", "zainab@example.com", "2025-03-20")
manager.add_guest(guest1)
manager.add_guest(guest2)
manager.add_guest(guest3)

# Display guest list
manager.display_all_guests()

# Update invitation date for Omar
manager.update_guest_invitation("Omar", "2025-03-15")

# Display updated guest lis
manager.display_all_guests()

# Send reminders
manager.send_reminders()
